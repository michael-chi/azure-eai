Overview
========

In this hands-on lab, we will be demonstrating a typical EAI message endpoint
pattern implementation with Azure Logic App and APIM.

In real world, each trading partner can use different protocols such as FTP,
HTTP and Queueâ€¦etc; Message pattern in EAI is to separate message sending and
receiving process with message channel, so that each part knows only small
pieces of the message processing process.

A high-level overview of the architecture illustrated below.

-   Trading Partner represents the organization that will be sending or
    receiving documents (sales orders for example).

-   Adapter Flow represents a sub-flow that handles incoming and outgoing
    messages, including transform and validation.

-   Transaction Flow is the flow to process this message, including enrich
    messages.

We will use this hands-on lab to create above flow. Below function and services
will be covered in this document.

-   Logic App

-   API Management

-   Azure AD

-   Azure Functions

-   Monitoring your flow
